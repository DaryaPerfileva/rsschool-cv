####Briefly about myself
Currently employed as a technical support specialist, I have developed a strong interest in learning programming languages. Through my work, I became fascinated by the inner workings of the services I assist with, prompting a desire to delve deeper into the mechanics behind buttons, forms, and overall system functionality. This curiosity fueled my personal exploration of programming languages.

One of my notable strengths is my dedication to continuous learning. I am highly motivated to acquire new knowledge and consistently seek opportunities to expand my skill set. With a demonstrated aptitude for quick learning, I am able to grasp new concepts and technologies efficiently. I maintain a strong commitment to personal and professional growth, ensuring that I stay well-informed about the latest industry advancements.

In addition, I hold a bachelor's degree in linguistics and had the privilege of pursuing a master's degree in artificial intelligence at FEFU. While I was unable to complete the program, I remain passionate about applying my technical knowledge to practical scenarios.

######*[Credit Card Mask](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5412509bd436bd33920011bc)*
*Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.*
```
def maskify(cc):
    cc_end = cc[-4:]
    cc_start = cc[:-4]
    return ''.join(['#' for i in range(len(cc_start))]) + cc_end
```
